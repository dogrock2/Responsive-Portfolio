                <p>My name is Alexander Nieves and I enjoy coding. When I was 18 I
                   took a course in electronics in a technical school. I graduated and
                   found a job pretty quick. Around two years later I wanted to learn new
                   skills so I decided to go to school for computer repairs and networking
                   but I only lasted about 2 months because the school went out of business.
                   I then decided to give computer programming a try.
                </p>
                <br> 
                <p id="p2">I took a programming course and even though I was able to finish it,
				   I was never able get a job as a programmer. I got discouraged and stopped 
				   searching. I did continue to code because I enjoyed it. In the last few years 
				   I decided to try again to see if I can get a job in as a programmer. I studied 
				   on my own and decided to get a few certifications. I received first the Linux 
				   certifications through compTIA and then I went for the Java certifications. I
				   obtained the first two Java programming certifications from Oracle. Finally I 
				   decided to go for the Rutgers coding bootcamp to learn up to date technology.
